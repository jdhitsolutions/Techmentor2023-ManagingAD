# Managing Active Directory with PowerShell

This repository contains the session material from my presentation at Live 360\Techmentor in Orlando, Florida November 2023.

## Abstract

If ever there was a technology that screamed for automation it is Active Directory. How can you create or modify 500 user accounts at once? How can you find obsolete computer accounts? How can you find empty groups? Fortunately, all of these tasks and more can be accomplished with PowerShell. This session will introduce you to the Active Directory module from Microsoft and demonstrate how to accomplish common management tasks with PowerShell.

Learning Objective 1: Learn how to manage Active Directory user accounts with PowerShell
Learning Objective 2: Learn how to manage Active Directory groups with PowerShell
Learning Objective 3: Learn how to create reports based on Active Directory
